                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>My name is Latreyana Parker. I am a fifth year senior at Auburn University graduating in December 2019. 
                    My major is Computer Science. While at Auburn I was apart of the Big Event where I was a Site Coordinator and Operations
                Committee member. During my time with the Big Event, I managed over 6 sites and about 30 volunteers that worked on those sites.
                During my summers, I completed an Intern position at Girls Impact where I worked with teenaged girls on increasing their proficiency
                in math and science. Also, I completed a mentorship with as a Lead Mentor at Summer Engineering Enrichment Program where I worked with a 
                team of three engineers and we came up with lessons that were Engineering related less for kids that was simple and very hands-on. We also 
                had the challenge of implementing these with the children grades 3rd-5th.</p>

                <p>Currently, I am employed at the Auburn University Political Science Office where I am a studnet assistant. My current role included: 
                    creating and maintaining a database of MCP and MPA information and assisting students with any needs that they have.
